# Cook4All 
In this repo you find the code from my capstone-project 'cook4all'. It's the final product of an intensive 3-month-bootcamp at neuefische. 
I designed and coded this App in 4 weeks to show and practice my newly acquired skills.

[Try it out!](https://capstone-cook4all.vercel.app/)

## About the app
Cook4All helps you to cook a single meal for all of your friends, relatives and anyone else - considering their possible intolerances and diets.

### How it works
First, you login as a new user and create guests you want to cook for. 
Then, you select guests you want to cook for and start searching for recipes that everyone can eat. That's it!

For each guest you can save up to 34 different intolerances and diets.
You can also filter the recipes for the type of meal, dish or cuisine you are looking for and you can save your favorite recipes.

## Technologies I used
Basically the MERN-Stack, so:
- React 
- styled components
- Express
- node
- MongoDB
